Grapevine is the most important cultivated plant species in terms of comercial value. It has a diploid genome with 19 pairs of chromosomes. It was only the second woody species to have its genome sequenced, and the first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Many different grape varieties have been bred around the world and play an important role in the cultural heritage of humanity since the Neolithic period. The first grape genome published was that of cultivar Pinot Noir PN40024. Analysis of the genome revealed several gene families that have expanded during the domestication of the species, with are related to wine characteristics: stilbene synthases and terpene synthases.
