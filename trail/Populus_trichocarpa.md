This is a broadleaf tree native to Western North America that belongs to the willow family (Salicaeae). It is an important source of timber and is deciduous, so each year sheds it leaves. The poplar is a fast growing tree that can reach reproductive maturity in as few as 4-6 years, permitting selective breeding for large-scale sustainable plantation forestry. Moreover, its genome is relatively small and for that reason was the first model species among trees. Poplar species are predominantly dioecious, meaning that their male and female reproductive structures are located in different individuals. This obligate outcrossing, along with wind pollination and wind dispersed plumose seeds, results in high levels of gene flow and high levels of heterozygosity. This is in contrast to other plant models, such as Arabidopsis thaliana or Brachypodium distachyon, which are highly homozygous.
